## Overview

Puddly is a cross-platform desktop companion built with **Electron** that helps users stay hydrated throughout the day.

Instead of sending traditional notifications, Puddly walks onto your desktop, reminds you to drink water through cute animations and interactive dialogues, and then walks away after you respond.

Designed to be lightweight, non-intrusive, and enjoyable to use.

## How It Works

1. Puddly quietly stays on your desktop.
2. After the configured reminder interval, she walks onto the screen.
3. A hydration reminder appears.
4. You can either:
   - I Drank
   - Snooze
5. Puddly responds with an animation and walks away.
6. The reminder timer resets automatically.
